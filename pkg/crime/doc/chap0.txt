  [1m[4m[31mAcknowledgements[0m
  This  project  wouldn't  have been possible without Jon Carlson. Jon devised
  the  algorithms  used  by  [22m[32mProjectiveResolution[0m,  [22m[32mCohomologyGenerators[0m,  and
  [22m[32mCohomologyRelators[0m,  having  already  implemented  them in [1mMagma[0m and sharing
  these programs with me.
  
  Thank  you  also  to Laurent Bartholdi for his helpful suggestions regarding
  the  [1mGAP[0m  implementation  and  the  user  interface. Laurent also tested the
  program extensively and uncovered many bugs.
