  This  project  would not have been possible without Jon Carlson. Jon devised
  the  algorithms  used  by  [22m[32mProjectiveResolution[0m,  [22m[32mCohomologyGenerators[0m,  and
  [22m[32mCohomologyRelators[0m,  having  already  implemented  them in [1mMagma[0m and sharing
  these programs with me.
