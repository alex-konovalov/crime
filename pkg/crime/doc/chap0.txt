  [1XAcknowledgements[0X
  This  project  would not have been possible without Jon Carlson. Jon devised
  the  algorithms  used  by  [9XProjectiveResolution[0X,  [9XCohomologyGenerators[0X,  and
  [9XCohomologyRelators[0X,  having  already  implemented  them in [5XMagma[0X, and shared
  these programs with me.
