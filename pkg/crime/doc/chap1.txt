  
  [1X1. Installation and Loading[0X
  
  Like other [5XGAP[0X packages, you download and unpack this package into [5XGAP[0X's [9Xpkg[0X
  directory.  For example, if you were using some Unix derivative and [5XGAP[0X were
  installed  in  the  directory  [9X/usr/local/gap4r4[0X,  then  you  would  do  the
  following.
  
  [4X-----------------------------  Log  ------------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ cd /usr/local/gap4r4/pkg[0X
    [4X$ su[0X
    [4X% wget 'http://math.uic.edu/~marcus/Crime/crime-1.2.tar.gz'[0X
    [4X% tar xvzvf crime-1.2.tar.gz [0X
    [4X[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  In  this  situation,  users would then load the package with the [9XLoadPackage[0X
  command.
  
  [4X-----------------------------  Log  ------------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ gap[0X
    [4Xgap> LoadPackage("crime");[0X
    [4X[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  Users  not  having root access, using someone else's computer, or having bad
  relationships  with  their network administrators, could install the package
  into  their  home  directories or into some other writable directory such as
  [9X/tmp[0X, and load the package as follows.
  
  [4X-----------------------------  Log  ------------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4X$ mkdir /tmp/pkg[0X
    [4X$ cd /tmp/pkg[0X
    [4X$ wget 'http://math.uic.edu/~marcus/Crime/crime-1.2.tar.gz'[0X
    [4X$ tar xvzvf crime-1.2.tar.gz [0X
    [4X$ gap -l ';/tmp'[0X
    [4Xgap> LoadPackage("crime");[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  Finally,  it  would  be a good idea to run the test file to confirm that all
  the functions work.
  
  [4X---------------------------  Example  ----------------------------[0X
    [4X[0X
    [4Xgap> ReadPackage("crime","tst/test.g");[0X
  [4X------------------------------------------------------------------[0X
  
  You  can  count yourself lucky if [5XGAP[0X doesn't complain about anything. There
  is  also  a  longer  running  test  file  for  those  having ample free time
  described in Appendix [14XB.[0X.
