  Below  is the output of the test file [22m[32mtst/batch.g[0m. The file runs through all
  groups   of   size   n,   which   is   initially   set   to   16,  and  runs
  [22m[32mProjectiveResolution[0m,  [22m[32mCohomologyGenerators[0m  and [22m[32mCohomologyRelators[0m for each
  group, and prints the results as well as the timings for each operation to a
  file.  The output below was computed on a 3.06 GHz Intel processor with 3.71
  GB  of RAM. The projective resolutions are calculated initially to degree 10
  and  the generators and relators to degree 6, due to the fact that I already
  knew  all  the  generators  and  relators  to  be of degree less than 6, see
  [34mhttp://www.math.uga.edu/~lvalero/cohointro.html[0m.    See    also   the   file
  [22m[32mtst/README[0m  for  suggestions  on  dealing  with  other  users  when  running
  long-running batch processes.
