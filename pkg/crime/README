This GAP package computes cohomology rings for 
finite p-groups using Jon Carlson's method, both as 
GAP objects, and also in terms of generators and 
relators. It also computes induced homomorphisms on 
cohomology and Massey products in the cohomology 
ring.

To install, download the package from
http://mad.epfl.ch/~bishop/Crime/crime-1.0.tar.gz
Put the package in GAP's pkg directory and unpack:
tar xvzvf crime-1.0.tar.gz

See the documentation in the doc directory for
more information.
