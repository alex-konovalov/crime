This GAP package computes cohomology
rings for p-finite groups, both as GAP
objects, and also in terms of generators
and relators. It also computes induced
homomorphisms on cohomology and
Massey products.

To install, download the package from
http://mad.epfl.ch/~bishop/Crime/crime-0.2.tar.gz
Put the package in GAP's pkg directory and unpack:
tar xvzvf crime-0.2.tar.gz
