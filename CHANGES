Changes from the 0.2 to the 0.3 versions.

Most importantly, the function DiagonalAction
uses a for-loop in place of the call to
KroneckerProduct. I thought I was so clever
for having written the entire function on one line
with one single call to KroneckerProduct, but in fact,
KroneckerProduct was taking up an inordinate amount
of processor time.

The same function has been renamed DownTheMiddle
to avoid a conflict with another GAP package.

The call to this function in lift.g on line 18
has been replaced by a single call at the top
of the j-loop, once per loop instead of every time.

And I threw in a ConvertToMatrixRep at that point,
which saves a few milliseconds.

Changed last line in batch.g from "Print(" to "AppendTo(f".

Added a comment to generators.gi explaining Size(H[1]).

Changed "X" to "Indeterminate" in relations.gi

Remarked that CohomologyRelators is *not* idempotent.
Thus, took C!.V away from the cohomology object
and included it as a local variable in CohomologyRelators.

Also as a local variable in CohomologyRelators is the
new variable IN which holds the indeterminate numbers.
This information is kept in order to fix a bug in Intersperse.

NiceIndeterminate was eliminated and incorporated into
CohomologyRelators.

CohomologyObject and CohomologyRing both use the filter
IsPGroup instead of IsGroup.

Added operation Inclusion.
