Changes from the 0.2 to the 0.3 versions.

Most importantly, the function DiagonalAction
uses a for-loop in place of the call to
KroneckerProduct. I thought I was so clever
for having written the entire function on one line,
but in fact, KroneckerProduct was taking 
up an inordinate amount of processor time.

The same function has been renamed DownTheMiddle
to avoid a conflict with another GAP package.

The call to this function in lift.g on line 18
has been replaced by a single call at the top
of the j-loop, once per loop instead of every time.

And I threw in a ConvertToMatrixRep at that point,
which saves a few milliseconds.

Changed last line in batch.g from "Print(" to "AppendTo(f".

Added a comment to generators.gi explaining Size(H[1]).

Changed "X" to "Indeterminate" in relations.gi

Remarked that CohomologyRelators is *not* idempotent.
Thus, took C!.V away from the cohomology object
and included it as a local variable in CohomologyRelators.

Also as a local variable in CohomologyRelators is the
new variable IN which holds the indeterminate numbers.
This information is kept in order to fix a bug in Intersperse.

NiceIndeterminate was eliminated and incorporated into
CohomologyRelators.

CohomologyObject and CohomologyRing both test that
G is a p-group via the TryNextMethod() mechanism.

Added functions Inclusion and BoundaryMap.

Added file doc/example.* which gives a better
explanation of the usage of BoundaryMap then the
manual.

Wrote a slick perl script packagecrime.pl to 
archive the package and another slick perl
script perl.pl to print all the code without
the comments.

Included p as a component of the CObject to avoid all
the calls to PrimePGroup and Characteristic.

Took away the K argument from CohomologyObject,
as K can be determined from M, and indeed, should
be the same.

Improved the argument testing in CohomologyObject.
